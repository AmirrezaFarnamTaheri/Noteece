# Restoring Data

Noteece provides several ways to restore your data, so you can be confident that your data is safe and secure.

## Restoring a Note from a Snapshot

Noteece automatically saves snapshots of your notes as you work. To restore a note from a snapshot, open the note you want to restore, click the "More" button in the top right corner of the editor, and then select "History". You will see a list of all the snapshots for that note. You can click on a snapshot to view it, and then click the "Restore" button to restore it.

## Restoring a Vault from a Backup

You can restore your entire vault from a `.noteece` file. To do so, go to the "Settings" screen, and then select "Import Vault". You will be prompted to select a `.noteece` file. Once you select a file, your vault will be restored.
