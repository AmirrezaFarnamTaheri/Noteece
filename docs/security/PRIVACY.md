# Privacy Policy for Noteece

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-18

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is critically important to us. Noteece is designed from the ground up to be a "zero-knowledge" application. This means we, the developers, have no access to your personal data or content.

## 1. Data Collection

- **No Personal Data:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal content. All notes, tasks, and other data you create are stored exclusively on your local devices.
- **No Telemetry or Analytics:** The application does not collect any usage data, analytics, or telemetry.
- **No Accounts or Servers:** Noteece is a server-less application. There are no user accounts to sign up for, and your data never passes through a central server.

## 2. Encryption

All of your data is encrypted at rest on your device using industry-standard SQLCipher with AES-256 encryption. The encryption key is derived from your password, which is never stored or transmitted. **If you lose your password, your data cannot be recovered.**

## 3. Syncing

When you use the local network sync feature, your data is transmitted directly between your own devices over your local Wi-Fi network. This transmission is end-to-end encrypted, and the data is never exposed to the internet or any third party.

## 4. Permissions (Mobile App)

The mobile application will request certain permissions to enable specific features (e.g., camera for photo capture). These permissions are only used for the stated purpose and are not used to collect any data.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
