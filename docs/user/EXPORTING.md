# Exporting Data

Noteece is designed to be a tool for life, and that means you should never feel locked in. You can export your data at any time, in a variety of formats.

## Exporting a Single Note

You can export a single note as a Markdown file, an HTML file, or a PDF file. To do so, open the note you want to export, click the "More" button in the top right corner of the editor, and then select "Export".

## Exporting a Space

You can export an entire space as a `.zip` file. This file will contain all of your notes as Markdown files, along with all of your attachments. To export a space, go to the "Spaces" screen, click the "More" button next to the space you want to export, and then select "Export".

## Exporting Your Entire Vault

You can export your entire vault as a `.noteece` file. This file is an encrypted, portable backup of your entire vault. You can use this file to transfer your vault to another device, or to restore your vault from a backup. To export your entire vault, go to the "Settings" screen, and then select "Export Vault".
