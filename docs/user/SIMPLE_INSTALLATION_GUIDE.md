sudo apt install nodejs npm

# On Windows:
# Download from https://nodejs.org
```

## Privacy & Security

### What Data Do We Collect?

**Nothing.** Seriously. Zero. Nada.

- ❌ No cloud storage
- ❌ No analytics
- ❌ No telemetry
- ❌ No tracking
- ✅ 100% local

### How Is My Data Protected?

1. **Password Protected**
   - Your password never leaves your device
   - When you log in, your password is checked using Argon2id. The key that actually unlocks your vault is made with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, repeated 256,000 times.
   - **To be clear:** this is a solid, widely used method, but it is **not** the strongest option available. PBKDF2 does not use much memory, which means someone with specialized cracking hardware can guess passwords far faster than against a memory-hard method like Argon2id. Your protection depends heavily on choosing a long, unique password.

2. **Encrypted Storage — on desktop**
   - On the desktop app, your notes are encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305 and the database is encrypted with AES-256.
   - **⚠️ On the phone app, your data is NOT encrypted.** It is stored in a plain, readable database on the device. Anyone who can get at your phone's files, or an unencrypted phone backup, can read your notes. Please do not store sensitive information in the mobile app until this is fixed.

3. **Secure Sync**
   - Only works on your local network
   - End-to-end encrypted
   - No internet required

### Can You See My Data?

**No.** Even if we wanted to (we don't), we can't because:

- Data never leaves your device
- Only you have the encryption key
- We don't have servers to store anything
