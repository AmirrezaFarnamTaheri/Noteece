# Notes & Knowledge Management

## The Core of Your Second Brain

The **Notes** feature is the foundational layer of Noteece. It allows you to capture, organize, and retrieve information efficiently.

## Features

### Markdown Editor

Noteece uses a custom-built, high-performance Markdown editor.

- **Formatting:** Bold, Italic, Lists, Headings, Blockquotes, Code Blocks.
- **Typewriter Mode:** Keeps your cursor vertically centered for focused writing.
- **Zen Mode:** Hides all UI chrome (sidebar, headers) to eliminate distractions.

### Organization

#### 1. Spaces

Top-level containers for isolation.

- **Examples:** "Personal", "Work", "Journal".
- Notes in one space are not visible in another (by default).

#### 2. Tags

Flexible categorization.

- Add tags inline using hash syntax: `#ideas`, `#project/alpha`.
- Tags are indexed for instant filtering.

#### 3. Backlinks (WikiLinks)

Connect ideas using bidirectional links.

- Type `[[` to trigger the autocomplete menu.
- Link to any other note by title.
- **Backlinks Panel:** See what notes link _to_ the current note. This helps discover hidden connections in your knowledge base.

### Search

The global search bar (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) is your gateway to everything.

- **Full-Text Search:** Searches title and content.
- **Filters:**
  - `tag:journal`: Find notes with tag "journal".
  - `created:today`: Find notes created today.
  - `has:todo`: Find notes with unchecked checkboxes.

### Version History

Every time you significantly modify a note, Noteece saves a compressed snapshot.

- View history to see how a note evolved.
- Restore previous versions if you make a mistake.
