# Project Hub

## Turn Ideas into Reality

The **Project Hub** is designed to manage complex initiatives that require more than a simple to-do list.

## Structure

1.  **Project:** The high-level container (e.g., "Launch Website", "Summer Vacation").
    - **Goal/Outcome:** Define _why_ you are doing this project.
    - **Status:** Active, On Hold, Completed, Archived.
    - **Deadline:** Optional target date.

2.  **Milestones:** Key checkpoints within a project.
    - Break down a large project into 3-5 major phases.
    - Example: "Design Phase", "Development Phase", "Testing Phase".

3.  **Tasks:** Actionable steps to complete milestones.
    - Tasks can be linked to a specific project.
    - **Recurrence:** Powerful recurring rules (e.g., "Every Monday", "Last Friday of the month") via `rrule`.

## Views

### 1. Dashboard Grid

A visual grid of all your active projects.

- **Progress Bars:** Visual indication of completion based on closed tasks.
- **Confidence Score:** A subjective metric (0-100%) you can set to track how you feel about the project's success probability.

### 2. List View

A dense, sortable list for quick management and review.

### 3. Kanban (Beta)

Drag-and-drop projects between statuses (Backlog -> Active -> Blocked -> Done).

## Workflow Integration

- **Linking:** You can link a Note to a Project to keep reference material close to your tasks.
- **Time Tracking:** Start a timer on any project task to log your hours.
