## Quantified Self & Habit Formation

Noteece believes that productivity is not just about tasks; it's about building better systems for living.

## Habits Tracker

The **Habits** widget helps you build consistency.

- **Frequency:** Daily or Weekly.
- **Streaks:** Visual "flames" 🔥 increase as you maintain your streak.
- **Completion Rate:** See your success rate over the last 30 days.

**Tip:** Start small. Track 1-3 keystone habits (e.g., "Read 10 mins", "Drink Water") rather than trying to change everything at once.

## Goals

Set high-level objectives that guide your projects.

- **SMART Goals:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
- **Hierarchy:** Link multiple Projects to a single Goal.
- **Visualization:** Progress rings show how close you are to achieving the goal (based on linked project completion).

## Weekly Review

A guided wizard to help you close out the week.

1.  **Reflect:** Review completed tasks and habits.
2.  **Clean Up:** Reschedule or delete overdue tasks.
3.  **Plan:** Select key projects for the upcoming week.
4.  **Journal:** Write a brief reflection on what went well and what didn't.

## Health Metrics

Manually log or import health data.

- **Metrics:** Sleep, Steps, Water Intake, Weight, Mood.
- **Correlations:** (Advanced) Noteece can analyze your data to find patterns. _Example: "You complete 20% more tasks on days you sleep > 7 hours."_
