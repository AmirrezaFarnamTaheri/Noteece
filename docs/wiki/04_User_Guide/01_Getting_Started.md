# Getting Started with Noteece

Welcome to your new second brain!

## 1. First Launch

When you open Noteece for the first time, you will be asked to create a **Vault**.
- **Password:** Choose a strong password. This password encrypts your master key. If you lose it, **your data is lost forever**. There is no "Forgot Password" feature because there is no server.

## 2. Orientation

- **Sidebar (Left):** Navigation to major modules (Notes, Projects, Goals, Dashboard).
- **Omnibar (Top):** Search (`Cmd+K`) and Command Palette.
- **Main Area:** Your workspace.

## 3. Your First Steps

1.  **Create a Space:** Go to Settings -> Spaces. Create a "Personal" space.
2.  **Write a Note:** Click "New Note". Write something. Try adding a tag like `#first`.
3.  **Set a Goal:** Navigate to the Goals tab. Create a goal (e.g., "Learn Noteece").
4.  **Create a Project:** Go to Project Hub. Create a project linked to that goal.

## 4. Syncing to Mobile

1.  Download the Noteece Mobile app.
2.  Ensure both Desktop and Mobile are on the **same WiFi**.
3.  **Desktop:** Go to Settings -> Sync -> "Pair New Device". A QR code appears.
4.  **Mobile:** Go to Settings -> Sync -> "Scan QR Code".
5.  Scan the code. Confirm the PIN code if prompted.
6.  Sync will begin automatically!
